CLIMenu is a menu system for command line applications.

The menu will resize itself to the required screen space when rendering, but a
minimum and maximum size may be specified. If the number of items is longer than
the maximum height, a scrolling list will be used. If the item text length is
longer than the maximum width, it will be truncated with ellipses.

Included with the system is an abstract MenuItem class, which all menu items
should inherit from. This class ensures that the item objects have the proper
event setup. When items are drawn on a menu, the .ToString() function is called,
so that's where you should program the output.

Additionally, you can specify the border characters, selection indicator, and the
scroll bar character. You can also choose to hide the selection indicator.

The menu also has PreRender and PostRender events for when you need to render
Additional data to the screen.
